Hi, 

This git repository contains examples of my various training projects.

Cypress

I uploaded my entire cypress course when I completed a number of years ago. The training course leader used intermixed files for different contexts.  

So for the sake of clarity I will add video (please copy and paste into browser if necessary).   This will clearly show BDD(with Page Objects) and Mocha  frameworks). 



It will be regularly updated and expanded. 

Best wishes
