Hi, 

This git repository contains examples of my various training projects.

Cypress

I uploaded my entire cypress course when I completed a number of years ago. 

The training course leader used intermixed files for different contexts.  

It's not how to would do things in a professional setting?

So for the sake of clarity I will add  a 

video.   This is example BDD overlay (with Page Object + Mocha).

It will be regularly updated and expanded. 

Best wishes
